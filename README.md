# Robin

This is a custom 3D game engine that I'm developing, roughly following [TheCherno's game engine series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) as a guide. The aim is to learn how a game engine works under the hood and to create a flexible lightweight, and powerful base for games and interactive applications. The engine is built as a static library and is currently linked to to projects, the runtime app sandbox which is being used to test features, and the editor to be used to create games with. 

## Implemented features 

### Rendering 
- Custom shader support
- Texture loading and rendering 
- Vertex buffer and index buffer management

### Maths and Graphics
- Currently supporting OpenGL through GLAD
- Orthogonal & perspective cameras with camera controllers
- Math primitves for transformations through GLM

### UI
- Editor using Dear ImGui
- UI Docking and a viewport for the game  

### Platform 
- Currently only supporting Windows 
- Window and context management through GLFW
- Event handling 
- Custom key and Mouse codes

### Core
- Timestep management and delta time calculation
- Basic Logging with different severity levels 
- Layer system for organized update/render orde
- event dispatcher and observer pattern 

## Current Next steps 

- **Runtime app and editor integration**: fully link the sandbox app and the editor such that changes made on the editor affect the runtime application 

- **Entity Component System:** Implement a ECS architecture with core components (Transform, MeshRenderer, Camera, Lights) 
- **Scene Management System:** Implement scene graph with hierarchical transforms, scene serialization, and scene switching capabilities
- **Primitives and model loading:** Add support for basic 3D primitives (cube, sphere, plane) and 3D model loading
- **Material System:** Create material definitions with shader bindings, material properties, and PBR support

## Future Goals 

### Short-term

- **Gizmos and Editor Tools:** Translation, rotation, scale gizmos with object manipulation
- **Asset Browser:** File system browser with drag-and-drop functionality
- **Batch Rendering:** Optimize draw calls with sprite batching and mesh instancing
- **Lighting System:** Point, directional, and spot lights with basic shadow mapping

### Medium-term

- **Post-Processing Pipeline:** Framebuffer management with bloom, SSAO, and tone mapping
- **Audio System:** 3D positional audio with FMOD or OpenAL integration
- **Scripting Support:** C# scripting integration with hot-reloading
- **Cross-platform File System:** Abstract file operations for asset packaging
- **Physics Engine:** Integration with Bullet Physics or custom physics implementation

### Long-term

- **Vulkan Support:** Modern graphics API support alongside OpenGL
- **Fully Fledged Editor:** Complete game development environment with visual editors
- **Linux and macOS Support:** Multi-platform deployment capabilities
- **Advanced Rendering:** Deferred rendering, PBR materials, and modern lighting techniques

## Architecture Overview
The engine follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

- **Core:** Application framework, logging, events, and platform abstraction
- **Renderer:** Graphics API abstraction, cameras, shaders, and rendering commands
- **Platform:** Window management, input handling, and OS-specific implementations
- **Editor:** ImGui-based tools and game development interface
- **Sandbox:** Test application for feature validation and development

## Dependencies

- **GLFW:** Window and input management
- **GLAD:** OpenGL function loading
- **GLM:** Mathematics library for graphics
- **Dear ImGui:** Immediate mode GUI
- **stb_image:** Image loading library
- **spdlog:** Fast C++ logging library

## Getting Started
Visual Studio 2022 is recommended for Windows development.

### Prerequisites

- Windows 10/11
- Visual Studio 2022 with C++ development tools
- Git with submodule support

### Setup Instructions


1. Clone the repository with submodules:
 
>git clone --recursive https://github.com/Praciv/Robin
2. Navigate to the project directory:
> cd Robin    
3. Run the project generation script:
> GenerateProject.bat
4. Open Robin.sln in Visual Studio 2022
5. Set the startup project to either Sandbox (for testing) or Editor (for development)
6. Build and run with F5 or Ctrl+F5
